# 3body
[The 3 body problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-body_problem) is a chaotic system of three orbitting point masses. This is a small program which animates a simulation of these orbits, given a user clicking initial positions of 3 masses. For each body, the program calculates attraction vectors to the other two masses consistent with the laws of gravity, and applies the sum of those vectors to each mass in the next frame.
